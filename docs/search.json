    "text": "Looping through Non-Numbers\nfor loops in R are a great way of repeating the same workflow iteratively rather than manually copy/pasting a given workflow for each case. for loops are so named because their syntax asks you for which groups you want to repeat the given workflow. The fundamental syntax is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nfor(single_group in all_groups){\n  ...workflow with each \"single_group\"...\n}\n\n\n\nIt is common to learn for loops by giving numbers to the for function and then conducting some sort of algebraic modification in the curly braces ({...}) after the for. For instance, we could square every number between 1 and 5 using a for loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nfor(j in 1:5){\n  # Square \"j\"\n  result <- j^2\n  # Print the result in each loop\n  print(result)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 4\n[1] 9\n[1] 16\n[1] 25\n\n\n\n\nIn each iteration of the loop above (i.e., for each value between 1 and 5), j becomes the next number in the provided sequence and squares it. At the end of the loop, your environment will have a value called j that is equal to 5 and an object called result that is equal to 25. This is because for loops only retain the final value of whatever passes through them. There are ways of adding each loop’s product to a single object so your output contains the results of all iterations of the loop but we will leave that for another time.\nWhile using numbers as the inputs for a for loop is great, many R users don’t realize that you can also use characters! This can be really useful if you have, for example, a dataset with many groups and you want to fit a linear regression for each level in your group column separately. To demonstrate this, we’ll use the penguins dataset included in the palmerpenguins R package.\nThe penguins dataset contains individual-level data on three penguin species (run ?penguins for more specific detail). Let’s say that we want to run compare the bill length between male and female penguins for each species. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll use a Student’s t-Test and extract only the p value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# For each species in the dataframe\nfor(sp in unique(penguins$species)){\n  \n  # Subset the data to the selected species and drop NAs in `sex`\n  data_sub <- subset(penguins, species == sp & !is.na(sex))\n  \n  # Now fit the t-test\n  stats <- t.test(data_sub$bill_length_mm ~ data_sub$sex)\n  \n  # And print the p-value!\n  message(\"For species \", sp, \" the p value is \", stats$p.value)\n}\n\nFor species Adelie the p value is 4.80108238442492e-15\n\n\nFor species Gentoo the p value is 1.31503894530191e-14\n\n\nFor species Chinstrap the p value is 8.91840858173204e-10\n\n\n\n\nThis can also be used to loop through the column names of a single dataframe or elements of a list! Supplying characters to a for loop can make the mental gymnastics of picturing your loop much simpler so definitely try this in your code!"

    "text": "One of the key tenets of programming is the DRY principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Essentially, this boils down to not repeating your code ad nauseum to change only one or two things. This is particularly useful for computationally intensive workflows that would require changing tens or hundreds of items. That’s where the for loop comes into play.\nFirst, let’s look at the basic syntax of a for loop. When you write one, you’re telling the computer “run this piece of code (statement) some number of times (range_of_values) in this spot (value).”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nfor(value in range_of_values){\n  statement \n  print(statement) \n}\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it! Congratulations, now you know the syntax for a basic for loop! Now let’s see it in practice. Now let’s put it into practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet’s say Europe is experiencing a heat wave, but I’m not quite grasping the context of how bad it is because I’m not familiar with the Celsius temperature scale. I know the average temperatures are somewhere between 35-40°C, so I’ll write a quick function to convert the temperatures into Fahrenheit! But that spans over five numbers, and writing that function out five individual times goes against the DRY principle. This gives us the perfect excuse to write a for loop.\nThe equation for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the following. \\[(deg C*1.8) + 32\\] Knowing that conversion formula, here’s how I’d write my for loop:\n\nfor(degC in 35:40){\n  # Write your statement. Make sure the output of the statement is assigned to an object,\n  # otherwise R will only remember the very last conversion value. \n  fahr <- (degC*1.8) + 32\n  \n  # Print the outputs\n  print(fahr)\n}\n\n[1] 95\n[1] 96.8\n[1] 98.6\n[1] 100.4\n[1] 102.2\n[1] 104\n\n\nYep, that’s pretty toasty!\n\n\nFor more help on for loops and other iterative processes, make sure to check out the R for Data Science book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund!"

To demonstrate this, we’ll use the penguins dataset included in the palmerpenguins R package.\nThe penguins dataset contains individual-level data on three penguin species (run ?penguins for more specific detail). Let’s say that we want to run compare the bill length between male and female penguins for each species. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll use a Student’s t-Test and extract only the p value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# For each species in the dataframe\nfor(sp in unique(penguins$species)){\n  \n  # Subset the data to the selected species and drop NAs in `sex`\n  data_sub <- subset(penguins, species == sp & !is.na(sex))\n  \n  # Now fit the t-test\n  stats <- t.test(data_sub$bill_length_mm ~ data_sub$sex)\n  \n  # And print the p-value!\n  message(\"For species \", sp, \" the p value is \", stats$p.value)\n}\n\nFor species Adelie the p value is 4.80108238442492e-15\n\n\nFor species Gentoo the p value is 1.31503894530191e-14\n\n\nFor species Chinstrap the p value is 8.91840858173204e-10\n\n\n\n\nThis can also be used to loop through the column names of a single dataframe or elements of a list! Supplying characters to a for loop can make the mental gymnastics of picturing your loop much simpler so definitely try this in your code!"
