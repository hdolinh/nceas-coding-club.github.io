Nick focuses on supporting LTER synthesis working groups in the acquisition and management prerequisite to analysis and visualization. Nick is a trained community ecologist with a special interest in interacting communities of plants and insects and has extensive experience taking "raw" field-collected data and readying it for hypothesis testing in a rigorous, transparent way. Nick completed his M.Sc. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University

**Goals:** Nick aims to refine his R package writing skills and become a more well-rounded programmer by increasing his competency with non-R programming languages.

## Althea Marks

Althea is a Data Science Fellow at the Arctic Data Center data repository. She is working on the "scythe" R package to improve the process of searching for dataset citations in scientific publication databases. Althea comes from an environmental science, water quality, and marine ecology background; she got the reproducible and open science bug while analyzing her graduate research and teaching herself to code.

**Goals for this website:**

-   Work collaboratively with many people using git/github
-   Learn how to create a webpage populated by a different github repo
-   Dig deeper into Quarto formatting
-   Use git in the command line for this website

## Camila Vargas Poulsen

Camila is working towards building the [Palmyra Atoll Data Library (PADL)](https://github.com/padl-project). She serves as the data manager, rescuing data collected at Palmyra Atoll to document and publish these data packages into the Environmental Data Initiative repository (EDI). As a data and project manager, Camila enjoys developing efficient workflows for cleaning, organizing, and documenting data, making it ready to be analized and ensure long-term preservation. Camila holds a Masters in Environmental Science & Management from the Bren School at UCSB.

**Data Science Tools:** RStudio and Github

**data-science-chats goals:** Learn new tools and packages. Staying abreast of best practices for open data science. Practice teaching data science tools. Support each other in our data science journey.

**Goals for this website:** Get familiar with Quarto. Use Github collaboratively. Learn from each other things we discover along the process of creating this website. Create a website that host small data science sparks from our day to day work.
