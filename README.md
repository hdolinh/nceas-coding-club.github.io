# Data Science Chats Website

This repository contains the collaborative website created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as a way of learning Quarto together!

## DSC Definition

Data Science Chats (DSC) is born from a desire to learn and teach peer-to-peer on all things data science and early career. Topics can be best practices or hack-y work-arounds -- the only guiding light is that you describe some data management/analysis task that you've found helpful (or request a talk on something you *would* find useful!). For now, we are comprised only of National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) employees but we may organically grow beyond that scope given time.

Scripts produced outside of this website can largely be found in the ["data-science-chats_scripts" GitHub repository](https://github.com/nceas-coding-club/data-science-chats_scripts) though because `git` is **not** prerequisite to joining DSC, not all scripts are placed in that repo.
